\opening{Gentlemen:}

The books arrived safely, the Stevenson is so fine it embarrasses my orange-crate bookshelves, I'm almost afraid to handle such soft vellum and heavy cream-colored pages. Being used to the dead-white paper and stiff cardboardy covers of American books, I never knew a book could be such a joy to the touch.

A Britisher whose girl lives upstairs translated the \pounds 1/17/6 for me and says I owe you \$5.30 for the two books. I hope he got it right. I enclose a \$5 bill and a single, please use the 70c toward the price of the New Testaments, both of which I want.

Will you please translate your prices hereafter? I don't add too well in plain American, I haven't a prayer of ever mastering bilingual arithmetic.

\closing{Yours,}

\ps
I hope `madam' doesn't mean over there what it does here.
