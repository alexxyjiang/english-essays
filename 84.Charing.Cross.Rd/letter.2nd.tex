\begin{letter}{Miss Helene Hanff\\14 East 95th Street\\New York 28, New York\\U.S.A.}
\opening{Dear Madam,}

In reply to your letter of October 5th, we have managed to clear up two thirds of your problem. The three Hazlitt essays you want are contained in the Nonesuch Press edition of his \textit{Selected Essays} and the Stevenson is found in \textit{Virginibus Puerisque}. We are sending nice copies of both these by Book Post and we trust they will arrive safely in due course and that you will be pleased with them. Our invoice is enclosed with the books.

The Leigh Hunt essays are not going to be so easy but we will see if we can find an attactive volume with them all in. We haven't the Latin Bible you describe but we have a Latin New Testament, also a Greek New Testament, ordinary modern editions in cloth binding. Would you like these?

\closing{Yours faithfully,}
\end{letter}
