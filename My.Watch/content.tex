\lettrine{M}{y} beautiful new watch had run eighteen months without losing or gaining, and without breaking any part of its machinery or stopping. I had come to believe it infallible\footnote{\textbf{infallible} adj. not capable of being wrong or making mistakes} in its judgments about time of day, and to consider its constitution and its anatomy\footnote{\textbf{anatomy} n. the parts or causes that form or create sth} imperishable\footnote{\textbf{imperishable} adj. never to be forgotten}. But at last, one night, I let it run down. I grieved\footnote{\textbf{grieve} v. to cause (someone) to feel sad or unhappy} about it as if it were a recognized messenger and forerunner\footnote{\textbf{forerunner} n. a sign of sth that is going to happen} of calamity\footnote{\textbf{calamity} n. an event that causes great harm and suffering}.
