\opening{Gentlemen:}

Your ad in the \textit{Saturday Review of Literature} says that you specialize in out-of-print books. The phrase `antiquarian book-sellers' scares me somewhat, as I equate `antique' with expensive. I am a poor writer with an antiquarian taste in books and all the things I want are impossible to get over here except in very expensive rare editions, or in Barners \& Noble's grimy, marked-up school-boy copies.

I enclose a list of my most pressing problems. If you have clean secondhand copies of any of the books on the list, for no more than \$5.00 each, will you consider this a purchase order and send them to me?

\closing{Very truly yours,}
\end{letter}
