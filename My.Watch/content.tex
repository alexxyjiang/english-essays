\lettrine{M}{y} beautiful new watch had run eighteen months without losing or gaining, and without breaking any part of its machinery or stopping. I had come to believe it infallible\footnote{\textbf{infallible} adj. not capable of being wrong or making mistakes} in its judgments about time of day, and to consider its constitution and its anatomy\footnote{\textbf{anatomy} n. the parts or causes that form or create sth} imperishable\footnote{\textbf{imperishable} adj. never to be forgotten}. But at last, one night, I let it run down. I grieved\footnote{\textbf{grieve} v. to cause (someone) to feel sad or unhappy} about it as if it were a recognized messenger and forerunner\footnote{\textbf{forerunner} n. a sign of sth that is going to happen} of calamity\footnote{\textbf{calamity} n. an event that causes great harm and suffering}. But by and by I cheered up, set the watch by guess, and commanded my bodings\footnote{\textbf{bode} v. (\textbf{n.} boding) to be a sign of (a future event or situation)} and superstitions\footnote{\textbf{superstition} n. a belief or way of behaving that is based on fear of the unknown and faith in magic or luck} to depart. Next day I stepped into the chief jeweler's to set it by the exact time, and the head of the establishment\footnote{\textbf{establishment} n. a place or organization where people live or do business} took it out of my hand and preceeded to set it for me. Then he said, ``She is four minutes slow--regulator\footnote{\textbf{regulator} n. a device for controlling the level or amount of sth (such as speed or temperature)} wants pushing up.'' I tried to stop him--tried to make him understand that the watch kept perfect time. But no; all this human cabbage\footnote{\textbf{cabbage} n. a person who leads a dull or inactive life} could see was that the watch was four minutes slow, and the regulator \textit{must} be pushed up a little; and so, while I danced around him in anguish\footnote{\textbf{anguish} n. extreme suffering, grief, or pain}, and implored\footnote{\textbf{implore} v. to make a very serious or emotional request to (someone)} him to let the watch alone, he calmly and cruelly\footnote{\textbf{cruel} adj. (\textbf{adv.} cruelly) used to describe people who hurt others and do not feel sorry about it} did the shameful deed. My watch began to gain. It gained faster and faster day by day. Within the week it sickened\footnote{\textbf{sicken} v. to become sick or to cause (someone) to become sick} to a raging\footnote{\textbf{raging} adj. causing a lot of pain or distress} fever, and its pulse\footnote{\textbf{pulse} n. a strong, regular beat or pattern of sounds in music} went up to a hundred and fifty in the shade. At the end of two months it had left all the timepieces of the town far in the rear, and was a fraction\footnote{\textbf{fraction} n. a part of amount of sth} over thirteen days ahead of the almanac\footnote{\textbf{almanac} n. a book published every year that contains facts about the movements of the sun and moon, changes in the tides, and information of general interest}. It was away into November enjoying the snow, while the October leaves were still turning. It hurried up house rent, bills payable, and such things, in such a ruinous\footnote{\textbf{ruinous} adj. causing or likely to cause damage or destruction} way that I could not abide\footnote{\textbf{abide} v. to accpet or bear (someone or sth bad, unpleasant, etc.)} it.
