\chapter{\textit{Martha}}
\lettrine{W}{hen} she opened her eyes in the morning it was because a young housemaid had come into her room to light the fire and was kneeling\footnote{\textbf{kneel} v. (\textbf{pt./pp.} knelt) to move your body so that one or both of your knees are on the floor} on the hearth\footnote{\textbf{hearth} n. the floor in front of or inside a fireplace}-rug raking\footnote{\textbf{rake} n. a tool that has a series of metal, wooden, or plastic pieces at the end of a long handle and that is used to gather leaves, break apart soil, make ground smooth, etc. \textbf{rake} v. to use a rake to gather leaves, break apart soil, make ground smooth, etc.} out the cinders\footnote{\textbf{cinder} n. a very small piece of burned material (such as wood or coal)} noisily. Mary lay and watched her for a few moments and then began to look about the room. She had never seen a room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy. The walls were covered with tapestry\footnote{\textbf{tapestry} n. a heavy cloth that has designs or pictures woven into it and that is used for wall hangings, curtains, etc.} with a forest scene embroidered\footnote{\textbf{embroider} v. to sew a design on a piese of cloth} on it. There were fantastically\footnote{\textbf{fantastic} adj. (\textbf{adv.} fantastically) extremely good} dressed people under the trees and in the distance there was a glimpse of the turrets\footnote{\textbf{turret} n. a small tower on a building} of a castle. There were hunters and horses and dogs and ladies. Mary felt as if she were in the forest with them. Ouot of a deep window she could see a great climbing stretch of land which seemed to have no trees on it, and to look rather like an endless, dull, purplish sea.

``What is that?'' she said, pointing out of the window.

Martha, the young housemaid, who had just risen to her feet, looked and pointed also.

``That there?'' she said.

``Yes.''

``That's th' moor,'' with a good-natured grin\footnote{\textbf{grin} v. (\textbf{n.} grin) to smile widely}. ``Dose tha' like it?''

``No,'' answered Mary. ``I hate it.''

``That's because tha'rt not used to it,'' Martha said, going back to her hearth. ``Tha' thinks it's too big an' bare\footnote{\textbf{bare} adj. not having a covering} now. But tha' will like it.''

``Do you?'' inquired\footnote{\textbf{inquire} v. to ask for information} Mary.
