\begin{letter}{Miss Helene Hanff\\14 East 95th Street\\New York 28, New York\\U.S.A.}
\opening{Dear Miss Hanff,}

Your six dollars arrived safely, but we should feel very much easier if you would send your remittances by postal money order in future, as this would be quite a bit safer for you than entrusting dollar bills to the mails.

We are very happy you liked the Stevenson so much. We have sent off the New Testaments, with an invoice listing the amount due in both pounds and dollars, and we hope you will be pleased with them.

\closing{Yours faithfully,}
\end{letter}
