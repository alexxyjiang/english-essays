\chapter{\textit{Mistress Mary Quite Contrary}}
\lettrine{M}{ary} had liked to look at her mother from a distance and she had thought her very pretty, but as she knew very little of her she could scarcely have been expected to love her or to miss her very much when she was gone. She did not miss her at all, in fact, and as she was a self-absorbed\footnote{\textbf{self-absorbed} adj. only caring about and interested in yourself} child she gave her entire thought to herself, as she had always done. If she had been older she would no doubt have been very anxious\footnote{\textbf{anxious} adj. afraid or nervous especially about what may happen} at being left alone in the world, bu she was very young, and as she had always been taken care of, she supposed she always would be. What she thought was that she would like to know if she was going to nice people, who would be polite to her and give her her own way as her Ayah and the other native servants had done.

She knew that she was not going to stay at the English clergyman's\footnote{\textbf{clergyman} n. a man who is a member of the clergy especially in a Christian church} house where she was taken at first. She did not want to stay. The English clergyman was poor and he had five children nearyly all the same age and they wore shabby\footnote{\textbf{shabby} adj. in poor condition especially because of age or use} clothes and were always quarreling\footnote{\textbf{quarrel} v. to argue about or disagree with something} and snatching\footnote{\textbf{snatch} v. to take (something) quickly or eagerly} toys from each other. Mary hated their untidy bungalow and was disagreeable to them that after the first day or two nobody would play with her. By the second day they had given her a nickname which made her furious\footnote{\textbf{furious} adj. very angry}.

It was Basil who thought of it first. Basil was a little boy with impudent\footnote{\textbf{impudent} adj. failing to show proper respect and courtesy} blue eyes and a turned-up nose, and Mary hated him. She was playing by herself under a tree, just as she had been playing the day the cholera broke out. She was making heaps of earth and paths for a garden and Basil came and stood near to watch her. Presently he got rather interested and suddenly made a suggestion.

``Why don't you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery\footnote{\textbf{rockery} n. \textit{(Brit)} rock garden}?'' he said. ``There in the middle,'' and he leaned\footnote{\textbf{lean} v. to bend or move from a straight position} over her to point.

``Go away!'' cried Mary. ``I don't want boys. Go away!''

For a moment Basil looked angry, and then he began to tease\footnote{\textbf{tease} v. to laugh at and criticize (someone) in a way that is either friendly and playful or cruel and unkind}. He was always teasing his sisters. He danced round and round her and made faces and sang and laughed.

\begin{center}
\textit{
``Mistress Mary, quite contrary\footnote{\textbf{contrary} adj. unwilling to obey or behave well},\\
How does your garden grow?\\
With silver bells, and cockle\footnote{\textbf{cockle} n. a type of shellfish with a shell that has two parts and is shaped like a heart } shells,\\
And marigolds\footnote{\textbf{marigold} n. a plant that is grown for its bright yellow or orange flowers} all in a row.''
}
\end{center}

He sang it until the other children heard and laughed, too; and the crosser Mary got, the more they sang `` Mistress Mary, quite contrary''; and after that as long as she stayed with them they called her ``Mistress Mary Quite Contrary'' when they spoke of her to each other, and often when they spoke to her.

``You are going to be sent home,'' Basil said to her, ``at the end of the week. And we're glad of it.''

``I am glad of it, too,'' answered Mary. ``Where is home?''
