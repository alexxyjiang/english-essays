\chapter{\textit{Martha}}
\lettrine{W}{hen} she opened her eyes in the morning it was because a young housemaid had come into her room to light the fire and was kneeling\footnote{\textbf{kneel} v. (\textbf{pt./pp.} knelt) to move your body so that one or both of your knees are on the floor} on the hearth\footnote{\textbf{hearth} n. the floor in front of or inside a fireplace}-rug raking\footnote{\textbf{rake} n. a tool that has a series of metal, wooden, or plastic pieces at the end of a long handle and that is used to gather leaves, break apart soil, make ground smooth, etc. \textbf{rake} v. to use a rake to gather leaves, break apart soil, make ground smooth, etc.} out the cinders\footnote{\textbf{cinder} n. a very small piece of burned material (such as wood or coal)} noisily. Mary lay and watched her for a few moments and then began to look about the room. She had never seen a room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy. The walls were covered with tapestry\footnote{\textbf{tapestry} n. a heavy cloth that has designs or pictures woven into it and that is used for wall hangings, curtains, etc.} with a forest scene embroidered\footnote{\textbf{embroider} v. to sew a design on a piese of cloth} on it. There were fantastically\footnote{\textbf{fantastic} adj. (\textbf{adv.} fantastically) extremely good} dressed people under the trees and in the distance there was a glimpse of the turrets\footnote{\textbf{turret} n. a small tower on a building} of a castle. There were hunters and horses and dogs and ladies. Mary felt as if she were in the forest with them. Ouot of a deep window she could see a great climbing stretch of land which seemed to have no trees on it, and to look rather like an endless, dull, purplish sea.

``What is that?'' she said, pointing out of the window.

Martha, the young housemaid, who had just risen to her feet, looked and pointed also.

``That there?'' she said.

``Yes.''

``That's th' moor,'' with a good-natured grin\footnote{\textbf{grin} v. (\textbf{n.} grin) to smile widely}. ``Dose tha' like it?''

``No,'' answered Mary. ``I hate it.''

``That's because tha'rt not used to it,'' Martha said, going back to her hearth. ``Tha' thinks it's too big an' bare\footnote{\textbf{bare} adj. not having a covering} now. But tha' will like it.''

``Do you?'' inquired\footnote{\textbf{inquire} v. to ask for information} Mary.

``Aye, that I do,'' answered Martha, cheerfully polishing\footnote{\textbf{polish} v. to make (something) smooth and shiny by rubbing it} away at the grate\footnote{\textbf{grate} n. a metal frame with bars across it that is used in a fireplace or to cover an opening}. ``I just love it. It's none bare. It's covered wi' growin' things as smells sweet. It's fair lovely in spring an' summer when th' gorse an' broom an' heather's in flower. It smells o' honey an' there's such a lot o' fresh air--an' th' sky looks so high an' th' bees an' skylarks\footnote{\textbf{skylark} n. a small bird of Europe, Asia, and northern Africa that sings while it flies} makes such a nice noise hummin'\footnote{\textbf{hum} v. to make a low continuous sound} an' singin'. Eh! I wouldn't live away from th' moor for anythin'.''

Mary listened to her with a grave\footnote{\textbf{grave} adj. very serious: requiring or causing serious thought or concern}, puzzled expression. The native servants she had been used to in India were not in the least like this. They were obsequious\footnote{\textbf{obsequious} adj. too eager to help or obey someone important} and servile\footnote{\textbf{servile} adj. very obedient and trying too hard to please someone} and did not presume to talk to their masters as if they were their equals. They made salaams\footnote{\textbf{salaam} n. A low bow as a ceremonial act of deference.} and called them ``protector of the poor'' and names of that sort. Indian servants were commanded to do things, not asked. It was not the custom to say ``please'' and ``thank you'' and Mary had always slapped her Ayah in the face when she was angry. She wondered a little what this girl would do if one slapped her in the face. She was a round, rosy, good-natured-looking creature, but she had a sturdy\footnote{\textbf{sturdy} adj. having or showing mental or emotional strength} way which made Mistress Mary wonder if she might not even slap back--if the person who slapped her was only a little girl.

``You are a strange servant,'' she said from her pillows, rather haughtily\footnote{\textbf{haughty} adj. (\textbf{adv.} haughtily) having or showing the insulting attitude of people who think that they are better, smarter, or more important than other people}.

Martha sat up on her heels\footnote{\textbf{heel} n. the back part of your foot that is below the ankle}, with her blackingbrush in her hand, and laughed, without seeming the least out of temper.
