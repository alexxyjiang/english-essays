\chapter{\textit{Across the Moor}}
\lettrine{S}{he} slept a long time, and when she awakened Mrs. Medlock had bought a lunchbasket at one of the stations and they had some chicken and cold beef and bread and butter and some hot tea. The rain seemed to be streaming down more heavily than ever and everybody in the station wore wet and glistening\footnote{\textbf{glisten} v. to shine with light reflected off a wet surface} waterproofs\footnote{\textbf{waterproof} n. \textit{(Brit)} raincoat}. The guard lighted the lamps in the carriage, and Mrs. Medlock cheered up very much over her tea and chicken and beef. She ate a great deal and afterward fell asleep herself, and Mary sat and stared at her and watched her fine bonnet slip on one side until she herself fell asleep once more in the corner of the carriage, lulled\footnote{\textbf{lull} v. to cause (someone) to fall asleep or become sleepy} by the splashing of the rain against the windows. It was quite dark when she awakened again. The train had stopped at a station and Mrs. Medlock was shaking her.

``You have had a sleep!'' she said. ``It's time to open your eyes! We're at Thwaite Station and we've got a long drive before us.''

The station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to be getting out of the train. The station-master spoke to Mrs. Medlock in a rough, good-natured way, pronouncing his words in a queer broad fashion which Mary found out afterward was Yorkshire.

``I see tha's got back,'' he said. ``An' tha's browt th' young 'un with thee.''

``Aye, that' her,'' answered Mrs. Medlock, speaking with a Yorkshire accent herself and jerking her head over her shoulder toward Mary. ``How's thy Missus?''

``Well enow. Th' carriage is waitin' outside for thee.''

A brougham\footnote{\textbf{brougham} n. A brougham was a light, four-wheeled horse-drawn carriage built in the 19th century} stood on the road before the little outside platform. Mary saw that it was a smart carriage and that it was a smart footman\footnote{\textbf{footman} n. a male servant who lets visitors into a house and serves food at the dinner table} who helped her in. His long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of his hat were shining and dripping\footnote{\textbf{drip} v. to fall in drops} with rain as everything was, the burly\footnote{\textbf{burly} adj. strong and heavy} station-master included.
